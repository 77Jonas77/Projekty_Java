In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, some with a sense of manifest destiny.[72] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[73] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[74] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[75] The Missouri Compromise attempted to balance desires of northern states to prevent expansion of slavery in the country with those of southern states to expand it, admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′ parallel.[76] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[77][78] The infamous Trail of Tears (1830–1850) was a U.S. government policy that forcibly removed and displaced most Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River to lands far to the west. These and earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.[79][80] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[81] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[82] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[72][83] The California Gold Rush of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the early 1870s,[84][85] just as additional western territories and states were created.[86]
